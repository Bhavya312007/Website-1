    <h1 id="main" class="heading">Machine Learning</h1>
    <div id="intro">
        <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to
            understanding and building methods that "learn" that is , methods that leverage
            data to improve performance on some set of tasks. It is seen as a part of
            artificial intelligence.</p>
        <p>Machine Learning algorithm build a model based on sample data
            , known as training data . In order to make predictions or decisions without
            being explicitly programmed to do so .</p>
        <p>A subset of machine learning is closely related to
            computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers,
            but not all machine learning is statistical learning.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="history">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur
                Samual , an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and
                artificial intelligence. The synonym self teching computers was also used in
                this time period.</p>
            <p>By the early 1960s, an experimental "learning machine "
                with punched tape memory ,called CyberTron,had been developed by Raytheon
                Company to analyse sonar signals, elcrocardigrams, speech patterns using
                rudimentary reinforcement learning.</p>
            <p>It was repetitively "trained "by a human operator/teacher
                to recognize pattern and equipped with a "goof" button to cause it to
                re-evaluate incorrect decisions.</p>
        </div>

    <h2 class="heading">Approches</h2>
    <div class="approches">
        <p>Machine has been divided into three categories depending
            on the nature of the signal or feedback :-</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Supervised Learning </li>
            <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
            <li>Reinforcement Learing </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            <span class="types">Supervised Learning :</span>
            The computer is presented with example input and their
            desired outputs, given by a "teacher ", and the goal is to learn a general rule.
            Ex: predicting house prices,Spam detection,etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="types">Unsupervised Learning :</span>
            No labels are given to learning algorithm, leaving it on
            its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learing can be a goal in
            itself or a means towards an end.Ex: dimension reduction.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="types">Reinforcement Learning :</span>
            A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in
            which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or plaing a
            game against an opponent ).As it navigates its problem space , the program is
            provided feedback that's anologous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.
            Ex:Gaming ,Image processing ,Automated robots.
        </p>

    <h2 class="heading">Limitations</h2>
    <div id="limit">
        <p>Although, machine learning has been transformative in some
            fields,machine learning programs often fail to deliver expected results. Reasons
            for this are numerous lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data
            bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms,wrong tools and people,
            lack or resources, and evaluation problems.</p>
        <p>Ex: In 2018, a self driving car from uber failed to detect a
            pedestrian , who was killed after a collision.
